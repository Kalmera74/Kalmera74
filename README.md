# Hi there 

I am  **Kamil**, a **game developer with 6+ years of experience** in building complex systems, optimizing performance, creating tooling, and leading projects from prototype to production. Over time, my work has naturally expanded into **backend development**, where I‚Äôve designed and maintained scalable systems to support live games and applications.  

I‚Äôm now **transitioning into backend engineering roles** with a strong focus on **.NET Core** and **Golang**.  
 Open to **backend developer opportunities** where I can apply my system design, memory management, concurrency, and optimization expertise.
